                           Each member came up with a variety of screens, for the challenges we wanted to offer, I had the idea to

                           tips that could encourage their choice to change their dietary needs.

                            Once we did our usability tests we learned we needed to adjust our navigation of the app by including actual back buttons.  We use one in our daily lives
                            but with smart phones, specifically Samsung, I can swipe my thumb up on the lower right of the screen and it goes back to the previous screen.  So it was 
                            easy to overlook such a common button.

                            The users that tested the app preferred videos to receive information that educated them.  So videos were an important factor to showcase recipes 
                            and tips to inform the user.  Having inviting images were appealing to some of the users, it enticed them to want to try different foods.  
                            The idea to include good to know tips in the app came from the users wanting to know how they were:

                           Designing the UI was my favorite part.  Bringing everything to life, adding color and images. I took the lead on the design aspect.
                           Green was a color the team agreed on but I insisted on the blue because based on color psychology blue was a favorite 
                           among users. Blue signifies trust and dependability, and it complements the green so well.
                       <p class="paragraph-text">
                           When designing the cards and buttons I like to include rounded corners because it make things look more modern. 
                            It was an important factor to include dietary preferences, types of allergies, texture preferences and health 
                            concerns such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol so that the app could suggest foods, restaurants and 
                            tips based on those preferences.

                This project was useful to me because at the time I was transitioning into becoming vegan-like. 
                I was, and still am, the vegan-curious.  Every now and then I indulge in some pork bacon, but 
                I incorporate more vegan friendly dishes as often as I can.  I thought about what my needs were 
                as someone who fit one of the personas when making sure someone that loved food, like I did could 
                find alternative ingredients to make foods we love without compromising on taste.  In addition to discovering myself and how I fit in the journey to becoming vegetarian, I also got 
                a feel for working in a group environment.  I learned how to resolve conflict when the group members 
                don't see eye to eye.  Most important I learned how to compromise and communicate effectively.
