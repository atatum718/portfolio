                            What we discovered about the vegan-curious is that they have health conditions that force them to look into alternative foods to eat.

                           This part was my favorite.  Bringing everything to life, adding color, images. I took the lead on the design aspect.
                           Green was a color the team agreed on but I insisted on the blue because based on color psycology blue was a favorite 
                           among users. Blue signifies trust and dependability, and it complements the green so well.

                           When designing the cards and buttons I like to include rounded corners because it make things look more modern.
